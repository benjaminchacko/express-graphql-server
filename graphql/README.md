# GraphQL typeDefs and Resolvers

## typeDefs

## Resolvers

## Other GraphQL Notes

// A schema is a collection of type definitions (hence "typeDefs")
// that together define the "shape" of queries that are executed against
// your data.

// Resolvers define the technique for fetching the types defined in the
// schema.

// Comments in GraphQL strings start with the hash (#) symbol.
